About
-----
I forked this repository from [This...](https://github.com/tomaz/ScrollingAboutWindow).

I studied this project as a very good example of Core Animation and CALayers.

The Author left as an exercise to the user to add the ability to stop the credits animations

upon a click of the mouse in the scrolling credits view. I found a solution, helped from

the Apple Documentation.
